Effects of an advertising ban

Consider two firms that produce and sell cigarettes (differentiated
products).

The demand functions are:

$$q_1=500-15p_1+5p_2+5\sqrt{A_1}-3\sqrt{A_2}
q_2=500+5p_1-15p_2-3\sqrt{A_1}+5\sqrt{A_2}$$

$q_i$ denotes the quantity, $p_i$ the price per unit and $A_i$ the
advertising expenditure of firm $i$, $i=1,2$. Marginal costs are
constant and equal to 2 per unit for both firms.

Consider a (one-shot pure) Nash equilibrium in which each firm sets its
own price and advertising level, conditional on the price and
advertising level of the competing firm.

a\) Denote the prices, advertising levels, quantities and profits in this
equilibrium.

$$\pi_1=(p_1-c)q_1-A_1
\pi_1=(p_1-2)(500-15p_1+5p_2+5\sqrt{A_1}-3\sqrt{A_2})-A_2$$

First, let’s solve for the equilibrium price level of firm $1$.

To do this, take the first order derivative with respect to $p_1$.

$$\frac{d\pi_1}{dp_1}=500-15p_1+5p_2+5\sqrt{A_1}-3\sqrt{A_2}+(p_1-2)*15=0$$

Solving for $p_1$ gives:

$$p_1=17\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{6}p_2+\frac{1}{6}\sqrt{A_1}-\frac{1}{10}\sqrt{A_2}$$

Similarly for firm 2 gives:

$$p_2=17\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{6}p_1+\frac{1}{6}\sqrt{A_1}-\frac{1}{10}\sqrt{A_2}$$

By substituting these best-response functions into each other, we can
solve for the equilibrium price levels.

Note, that the firms are symmetric! This implies that price levels and
advertisement levels of both firms are equal.

$$p_1=17\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{6}p_1+\frac{1}{6}\sqrt{A_1}-\frac{1}{10}\sqrt{A_2}
p_1=p_2=21\frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{25}\sqrt{A_1}$$

Second, let’s solve for the equilibrium advertisement level of firm $1$.

To do this, take the first order derivative with respect to $A_1$.

$$\frac{d\pi_1}{dA_1}=(p_1-2)(2\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{A_1}})-1=0$$

Solving for $A_1$ gives:

$$A_1=A_2=(2\frac{1}{2}p_1-5)^2$$

Now we have 2 equations, with 2 unknowns. We can substitute the
functions into each other, which will gives the solution of the
equilibrium price and advertisement levels.

The final solution is:
$$p_1^*=p_2^*=26, A_1^*=A_2^*=3600, q_1^*=q_2^*=360 & \pi_1^*=\pi_2^*=5040$$

b\) Investigate the effects of a ban on cigarette advertising. Explain
(in words) why an advertising ban can increase profits.

Now firms can only determine their prices.

To determine the new price level, take the first order derivative with
respect to price.

$$\frac{d\pi_1}{dp_1}=500-15p_1+5p_2+(p_1-2)*-15=0$$

Solving for $p_1$ gives:

$$p_1=17\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{6}p_2$$

Similary for firm 2:

$$p_2=17\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{6}p_1$$

Substituting these best-reponse functions into each other will give the
equilibrium price level.

Note that firms are symmetric!

$$p_1=17\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{6}p_1$$

Solving for $p_1$ gives:

$$p_1^*=p_2^*=21.20$$

Next solve for the equilibrium quantities and profits.

$$q_1^*=q_2^*=288 & \pi_1^*=\pi_2^*=5530$$

The results show that when firms are not any longer allowed to advertise
they can actually achieve higher profits! On the one hand, the
advertisement ban decreases demand and therefore profits. On the other
hand, firms will decrease their prices which gives upward pressure on
demand and profits. If the price decrease is high enough it will offset
the downward pressure on profits and might even increase profits.
